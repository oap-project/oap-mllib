It is compatible with Spark MLlib and leverages open source Intel\u00ae oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) to provide highly optimized algorithms and get most out of CPU and GPU capabilities. It also take advantage of open source Intel\u00ae oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL) to provide efficient communication patterns in multi-node multi-GPU clusters. Compatibility OAP MLlib maintains the same API interfaces with Spark MLlib. That means the application built with Spark MLlib can be running directly with minimum configuration. Most of the algorithms can produce the same results that are identical with Spark MLlib. However due to the nature of distributed float point operations, there may be some small deviation from the original result, we will make sure the error is within acceptable range and the accuracy is on par with Spark MLlib. For those algorithms that are not accelerated by OAP MLlib, the original Spark MLlib one will be used. Online Documentation You can find the all the OAP MLlib documents on the project web page . Getting Started Java/Scala Users Preferred Use a pre-built OAP MLlib JAR to get started, you can download OAP MLlib JAR from Release Page . Then you can refer to the following Running section to try out. Python/PySpark Users Preferred Use a pre-built JAR to get started. If you have finished OAP Installation Guide , you can find compiled OAP MLlib JAR oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar in $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/ . Then you can refer to the following Running section to try out. Building From Scratch You can also build the package from source code, please refer to Building section. Running Supported Spark Versions OAP MLlib's latest version supports multiple Spark versions as below. Apache Spark 3.1.1 Apache Spark 3.1.2 Apache Spark 3.1.3 Apache Spark 3.2.0 Apache Spark 3.2.1 Prerequisites CentOS 7.0+, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS+ Java JRE 8.0+ Runtime Apache Spark 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.2.0 or 3.2.1 Generally, our common system requirements are the same with Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkit, please refer to Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit System Requirements for details. Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkits components used by the project are already included into JAR package mentioned above. There are no extra installations for cluster nodes. Spark Configuration General Configuration YARN Cluster Manager Users usually run Spark application on YARN with client mode. In that case, you only need to add the following configurations in spark-defaults.conf or in spark-submit command line before running. # absolute path of the jar for uploading spark.files /path/to/oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar # absolute path of the jar for driver class path spark.driver.extraClassPath /path/to/oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar # relative path of the jar for executor class path spark.executor.extraClassPath ./oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar Standalone Cluster Manager For standalone cluster manager, you need to upload the jar to every node or use shared network folder and then specify absolute paths for extraClassPath. # absolute path of the jar for driver class path spark.driver.extraClassPath /path/to/oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar # absolute path of the jar for executor class path spark.executor.extraClassPath /path/to/oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar OAP MLlib Specific Configuration OAP MLlib adopted oneDAL as implementation backend. oneDAL requires enough native memory allocated for each executor. For large dataset, depending on algorithms, you may need to tune spark.executor.memoryOverhead to allocate enough native memory. Setting this value to larger than dataset size / executor number is a good starting point. OAP MLlib expects 1 executor acts as 1 oneCCL rank for compute. As spark.shuffle.reduceLocality.enabled option is true by default, when the dataset is not evenly distributed accross executors, this option may result in assigning more than 1 rank to single executor and task failing. The error could be fixed by setting spark.shuffle.reduceLocality.enabled to false . Sanity Check Setup env.sh $ cd conf $ cp env.sh.template env.sh Edit related variables in \" Minimun Settings \" of env.sh Upload example data files to HDFS $ cd examples $ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal data / $ hadoop fs -ls data Run K-means $ cd examples/kmeans $ ./build.sh $ ./run.sh PySpark Support As PySpark-based applications call their Scala counterparts, they shall be supported out-of-box. Examples can be found in the Examples section. Building Prerequisites We use Apache Maven to manage and build source code. The following tools and libraries are also needed to build OAP MLlib: JDK 8.0+ Apache Maven 3.6.2+ GNU GCC 7+ Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit (>=2022.1) Components : DPC++/C++ Compiler (dpcpp/clang++) Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) MPI Library (MPI) Collective Communications Library (oneCCL)] Generally you only need to install Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit for Linux with all or selected components mentioned above. Intel\u00ae oneAPI Base Toolkit can be downloaded and installed from here . Installation process for oneAPI using Package Managers (YUM (DNF), APT, and ZYPPER) is also available. More details about oneAPI can be found here . Scala and Java dependency descriptions are already included in Maven POM file. Note: You can refer to this script to install correct dependencies. Build To clone and checkout source code, run the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/oap-project/oap-mllib.git Optional to checkout specific release branch: $ cd oap-mllib && git checkout ${version} We rely on environment variables to find required toolchains and libraries. Please make sure the following environment variables are set for building: Environment Description JAVA_HOME Path to JDK home directory DAALROOT Path to oneDAL home directory TBB_ROOT Path to oneTBB home directory I_MPI_ROOT Path to Intel MPI home directory CCL_ROOT Path to oneCCL home directory We suggest you to source setvars.sh script into current shell to setup building environments as following: $ source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh You can also refer to this CI script to setup the building environments. If you prefer to buid your own open source oneDAL , oneTBB , oneCCL versions rather than use the ones included in oneAPI Base Toolkit, you can refer to the related build instructions and manually source setvars.sh accordingly. To build, run the following commands: $ cd mllib-dal $ ../dev/prepare-build-deps.sh $ ./build.sh The built JAR package will be placed in target directory with the name oap-mllib-x.x.x.jar .
