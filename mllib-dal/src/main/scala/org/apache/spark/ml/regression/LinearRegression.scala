/**
 * Linear regression.
 *
 * The learning objective is to minimize the specified loss function, with regularization.
 * This supports two kinds of loss:
 *  - squaredError (a.k.a squared loss)
 *  - huber (a hybrid of squared error for relatively small errors and absolute error for
 *  relatively large ones, and we estimate the scale parameter from training data)
 *
 * This supports multiple types of regularization:
 *  - none (a.k.a. ordinary least squares)
 *  - L2 (ridge regression)
 *  - L1 (Lasso)
 *  - L2 + L1 (elastic net)
 *
 * The squared error objective function is:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   $$
 *   \begin{align}
 *   \min_{w}\frac{1}{2n}{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_{i}w - y_{i})^{2} +
 *   \lambda\left[\frac{1-\alpha}{2}{||w||_{2}}^{2} + \alpha{||w||_{1}}\right]}
 *   \end{align}
 *   $$
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * The huber objective function is:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   $$
 *   \begin{align}
 *   \min_{w, \sigma}\frac{1}{2n}{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\sigma +
 *   H_m\left(\frac{X_{i}w - y_{i}}{\sigma}\right)\sigma\right) + \frac{1}{2}\lambda {||w||_2}^2}
 *   \end{align}
 *   $$
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * where
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *   $$
 *   \begin{align}
 *   H_m(z) = \begin{cases}
 *            z^2, & \text {if } |z| &lt; \epsilon, \\
 *            2\epsilon|z| - \epsilon^2, & \text{otherwise}
 *            \end{cases}
 *   \end{align}
 *   $$
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Since 3.1.0, it supports stacking instances into blocks and using GEMV for
 * better performance.
 * The block size will be 1.0 MB, if param maxBlockSizeInMB is set 0.0 by default.
 *
 * Note: Fitting with huber loss only supports none and L2 regularization.
